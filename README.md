## App Description

The Survey Request Form was built to satisfy work order requests for survey projects. Users are required to click on the map to select a point. Once a location has been selected, the user must fill out all input fields. Users can search for existing projects by using the search bar on the Main page. Alternatively, users can navigate to the Search page and search for a project there. A list of all projects entered can be seen on the Projects page. The Time page is a placeholder for the time being and does not have any functionality other than displaying Nicholas Cage pictures. <br>

API requirements were fullfilled through the following: <br>
The asset area input pulls values from https://swapi.co/api/planets/ <br>
The vendor input pulls values from http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters <br>
The project type input pulls values from https://swapi.co/api/people/ <br>
The bill number type input pulls values from https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries <br>
